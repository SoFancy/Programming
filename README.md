# Programming Exercises
Personal and public storage of the programming exercises I've done. 

Generally, I will try to write most exercises in several different programming languages, but as I write this I'm learning rust so that will be the "go-to" language for any exercises. It's likely that at first most exercises will only be in rust.

The folder structure should be something like this:

* Beginner
    * Exercise X
        * rust
        * python
        * etc.
* Intermediate
* Advanced
